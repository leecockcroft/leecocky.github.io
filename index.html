		<p>The objective is to get a higher score than the dealer without surpassing 21.
		The Blackjack tables usually come in seats on 6 with 1 dealer. 
		Lets say you want to stake $10 a hand. The game starts with the player placing his bets (we'll say $10). The dealer then deals, two cards face up to the player(lets say 4 hearts, 5 clubs, players total = 9), and 2 cards to himself showing only one card.
		the player has 3 options,</p> 

		<ul>
			<li><em> 'hit' </em></li>

			 <li><em>'Stand'</em></li>
			 <li><em>'double down'</em></li>
		</ul>
</div>
<div class="middle-section">


			<h4>Hit</h4>
				<p> This just basically means you want another card. The dealer will give you another card which you'll add to your current score.</p>
					<h4> Stand</h4>

						<p> Stand means you're happy with your score and you dont want another card</p>

							<h4> Double down</h4>
								<p> If a player decides to double down he will have to put the same value of his stake down, usually players double down on 11. so in this example the player puts $10 down, if he decides to "double down" he will need to put another $10 in. so now his total stake is $20, if he beats the dealer player wins $20 (+$20 stake back). Once you double down you will ONLY recieve one more card, then you're forced to stand.</p>

								<p> If the players score is under 21 and has choice to "stand" the dealer flips over his second card! He MUST have a score of at least 16, if under he is forced to "hit". If the dealer goes over 21, or his cards value is lower than your, the player wins.<br>
								Below is the payout guideline:</p>

				<h2> Roulette</h2>

					<div class="flex-text">
				<p>Roulette is a game played with a large wheel that contains 37 pockets. These stops are numbered from 0 to 36,. All the pockets are all colored; the zeroes are green, while the other spots are evenly divided between 18 red and 18 black.
				The croupier spins a ball on the outer rim of the wheel, after which it will eventually fall into one of the numbered pockets.The Aim of the game is for the player to guess the correct number.
				However, these can include a variety of different bets such as "red or black?" or "number between 1-18".

				<p>With the strip over 4 miles long including 30 hotels, its usually very difficult researching every single hotel.
					If you want to stay on the strip the most imporrtant factor is location!!!! Believe me! Every hotel on that strip is pretty much amazing!!!Some are obviously more dated than others, but they are still pretty cool.</p>
					<p> Last Year I stayed at the Excalibur, and can't fault this hotel at all! Saying that, i've booked to go back in September!. The price is always cheap the location is good, all you need!how long do you really want to stay in your hotel room?!. </p>

					<p> <a href="https://www.booking.com">https://www.booking.com</a> is a great site to get the list of hotels up and see what they have to offer, but my advise "you're only there for a kip, so its absolutely fine if its on the strip".</p>
